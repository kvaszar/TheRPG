In the heart of the mystical forest of Elvendom, where ancient trees whispered secrets to the wind, and the soft rustle of leaves signaled the presence of unseen creatures, your journey begins. You are a brave adventurer, driven by a sense of curiosity and a thirst for knowledge. Your quest is to uncover the secrets of the long-abandoned Temple of the Golden Sun, hidden deep within the scorching desert of Aridian.
As you set foot in the forest, the canopy above filters the sunlight, casting dappled shadows on the forest floor. The air is filled with the sweet scent of blooming wildflowers and the gentle chirping of birds. A narrow dirt path unwinds before you, disappearing into the dense foliage. The trees seem to close in around you, their branches tangling above your head like skeletal fingers.
You've heard rumors of a hidden clearing, where the ancient druids once performed their sacred rituals. The clearing is said to be hidden behind a waterfall, which cascades down a rocky slope. To reach the clearing, you must navigate the treacherous forest terrain, avoiding deadly creatures and overcoming obstacles.
As you journey deeper into the forest, the trees grow taller, and the underbrush thicker. You hear the distant howling of wolves and the snapping of twigs beneath unseen feet. The forest is alive, and you are not alone.
After a few hours of walking, you come across a fork in the path. The left path appears well-trodden and easy to follow, but you sense that it may be a trap set by the forest's inhabitants. The right path is overgrown and treacherous, but it may lead you to a hidden shortcut.
<ch>
left<->Take the left path, hoping to avoid danger and find a safe route to the clearing.
right<->Take the right path, willing to risk the unknown in search of a shortcut.

You take the left path, hoping to avoid danger and find a safe route to the clearing. The path is well-trodden and easy to follow, and you make good time as you walk. However, as you round a bend in the path, you hear the sound of rustling leaves and twigs snapping. Suddenly, a goblin emerges from the underbrush, its eyes fixed on you with a hungry gleam.
The goblin is small and wiry, but it's vicious and well-armed. You prepare to defend yourself, but you realize that you may be able to bribe the goblin instead.
<ch>
fight goblin<->Engage in combat with the goblin
pay<->Offer the goblin a bribe in exchange for leaving you alone (Gold cost: 5 gold pieces)

You take the right path, willing to risk the unknown in search of a shortcut. The path is overgrown and treacherous, and you have to push aside thick branches and fight your way through thorny underbrush. However, as you walk, you notice that the path is eerily quiet. You don't hear any birds singing or animals scurrying through the underbrush.
After a few minutes of walking, you come across a small stream. The stream is crystal clear, and you can see fish swimming in the shallows. You follow the stream, using it as a guide as you make your way through the forest.
As you walk, you notice that the stream leads you to a small waterfall. The waterfall is beautiful, and you can see a hidden cave behind the falling water. You enter the cave, and you find a small chamber filled with ancient artifacts and mysterious symbols.
However, as you explore the chamber, you hear the sound of a slime approaching. The slime is a slow-moving creature, but it's deadly and corrosive. You realize that you may be able to outsmart the slime instead.
<ch>
fight slime<->Engage in combat with the slime
flee<->Try to outsmart the slime by using your knowledge of the environment (Intellect check: DC 10)

As you continue on your journey, you come across a traveling merchant who has set up a small stall in the middle of the forest. The merchant is a friendly old man who is eager to do business with you.
"Ah, a brave adventurer, I see," the merchant says with a smile. "I have just the thing for you. Take a look at my wares and see if anything catches your eye."
The merchant shows you a selection of goods, including a rare book, a magical potion, a set of fine clothes, and a small sack of gold coins.
